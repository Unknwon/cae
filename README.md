Package cae implements PHP-like Compression and Archive Extensions.

But this package has some modifications depends on Go-style.

Reference: [PHP:Compression and Archive Extensions](http://www.php.net/manual/en/refs.compression.php).

Code Convention: based on [Go Code Convention](https://github.com/unknwon/go-code-convention).

### Implementations

Package `zip`([Go Walker](http://gowalker.org/github.com/unknwon/cae/zip)) and `tz`([Go Walker](http://gowalker.org/github.com/unknwon/cae/tz)) both enable you to transparently read or write ZIP/TAR.GZ compressed archives and the files inside them.

- Features:
	- Add file or directory from everywhere to archive, no one-to-one limitation.
	- Extract part of entries, not all at once. 
	- Stream data directly into `io.Writer` without any file system storage.

### Test cases and Coverage
